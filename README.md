## Description

Weather dashboard showing a 5-day forecast with a city search functionality.

This app uses the Open Weather API to display the current weather and a 5 day weather forecast based on the searched city. It also gives the option to click on previous searches and display the updated data for those cities.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

![Screenshot of the weather dashboard](./assets/images/screenshotOne.png)

When users first enter the page, they see the search bar and are prompted to search for a city. When they click on the 'Search' button, the current day data is displayed on the right hand side, with a 5 day forecast underneath.

If needed, users can perform searches for different cities, and the search history will be saved underneath the search button as clickable buttons.
